  title: "The Airlock"
  description: "You find yourself floating in a cozy, brightly lit cylinder, rotating slowly in the zero gravity. As you turn, you see a small porthole at your feet, showing the black void of space, and above your head is a circular door, with handles framing it and a big red button that just lit up, inviting you to enter. The Phobos University logo is stenciled on the wall."

  title: "Central Access Shaft: Yellow Floor"
  description: >-
    You grab a rung of a ladder that is running the length of a dark access tube to keep yourself from floating away in the zero gravity. Yellow lights glow on one side of you, illuminating the drop pod to the engineering level. You can also continue -- shall we call it up? It's away from the airlock, and above your head as a result, to the next level of the Central Access Shaft.

  description: >-
    You grab a handle to keep yourself from floating away as you meet the glowing magenta entrance of the commons area drop pod. You can go back (down) to the yellow light beneath your feet -- although the whipped over your head as you grabbed on to stop yourself, but lets call it down, anyway. To the opposite direction is up, the blue-lighted gateway to the Academic level.

  title: "Central Access Shaft: Blue"
  description: >-
    You hold on to the central access shaft ladder grips to steady yourself in the blue glow of the drop pod entrance to the Academic floor. You can see a green glow overhead, and beyond it what looks like the open blackness of the void of space. Looking the other way you also head down to the magenta floor.

  title: "The Common Area"
  description: >-
    A completely black room. Somehow all of the light that should be coming from the room to the west does not pass
    through the archway. A single lightbulb hangs from the ceiling illuminating a small area. To the east you see a
    large white dome. There is a sign above the entrance to the dome: "Training Area"
